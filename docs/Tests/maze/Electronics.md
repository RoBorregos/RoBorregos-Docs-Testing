### ‚öôÔ∏è **System Functionality**

- **Distance Measurement**: VL53L0X sensors detect nearby walls and help the robot center itself on the tiles and detect ramps.
- **Victim Detection**: Jetson Nano processes images from LMX219 cameras and uses WS2812 LEDs for standardized blinking, as required by [RCJ rules 2025](https://junior.robocup.org/robocupjunior-general-rules/).
- **Tile Identification**: The TCS34725 color sensor recognizes checkpoints (silver), blue tiles (puddles), and black tiles (holes).
- **Motor Feedback**: Pololu motors with encoders provide real-time velocity data to the ESP32.
- **Orientation**: BNO055 ensures accurate 90¬∞ turns and detects slopes.
- **I2C Expansion**: The TCA9548A allows communication with multiple I2C devices without address conflict.
- **User Interface**: SSD1306 OLED screen displays debug info, and a push button is used for start/reset operations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- All sensors and actuators were tested to comply with the environmental tolerance requirements specified in the [RCJ Rescue Maze Rules 2025 PDF](RCJRescueMaze2025-final-1.pdf).
- The ESP32 handles low-level control and sensor polling, while the Jetson Nano is dedicated to computer vision processing.
